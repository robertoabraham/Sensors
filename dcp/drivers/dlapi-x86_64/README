# DLAPI Software Development Kit - Linux x86_64

Thank you for downloading the Diffraction Limited DLAPI SDK version 2.1.0.0 for Linux.
This release provides basic USB connectivity for DLAPI compliant cameras (e.g. the Aluma series of cameras).
Ethernet/WiFi support is still in development.

Note that this SDK was built for Debian-based distros of Linux (built specifically on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
and the configuration and rules files in conf and udev are only applicable to those distros.

## Contents 

* Binary redistributables for static and dynamic linking,
* A sample application which connects to a USB camera, retrieves its serial number and takes a picture,
* Header files necessary for building your own applications
* udev rules for detecting your camera without sudoer privileges (Debian only)
* ld.conf rules for automatically adding dlapi to your library load path (Debian only)

## Installation
Simply run the installer script provided with this package with sudoer privileges:

```
sudo ./install
```

This will place the library's header files in /usr/local/include, and the binaries in /usr/local/lib.

## Sample Application

A precompiled x86_64 binary is provided in ./sample, along with a makefile for your own edification.
To compile and run it, simply type the following commands in your temrinal:

```
cd sample
make
./main
```

If the sample application does not detect your camera, try running the application with sudoer privileges.
If the application works with sudoer privileges, but not without, then you likely haven't loaded the 
custom udev rules provided by the installer script. You can install them manually with:

```
sudo cp udev/51-sbig-debian.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
```

If the application runs as intended, then you should see your camera's serial number, and the average
ADU of a dark frame displayed in the terminal.
